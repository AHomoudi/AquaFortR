# Summary

- positive features of R 
- positive features of Fortran 
  <!-- - https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kley/lehre/ftn77/tutorial/arrays2.html -->
- Why .Fortran() should not be used. dotCall64 is recommended for scripts. 
- Mention the memory allocation issues related to .Fortran
- OpenMp implementation in Fortran, [Romp](https://github.com/wrathematics/Romp) 
- Explain how beneficial R, Fortran with OpenMP is. For examples calculating cape for each vertical profile 
in a high resolution (1-4km) climate simulation (years) output (nlat, lon, nlevels, ntime) can be accelerated 
by passing the whole input arrays from R to Fortran, then loop over (nlat, lon, ntime) with OpenMP. 

- The cross-correlation can be speed up by using FFT. Also, in Fortran, the FFTW C library can be used. 
In summary, this book has no content whatsoever.
- Possibility of calling BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK linear algebra functions Fortran using C (R_ext/BLAS.h, R_ext/Lapack.h and R_ext/Linpack.h)

- Final words why packaging is better.

<!-- Fortran is primarily intended for Fortran 77 code, and long precedes any support for Fortran 9x. Now current implementations of Fortran 9x support the Fortran 2003 module iso_c_binding, a better way to interface modern Fortran code to R is to use .C and write a C interface using use iso_c_binding.  -->

<!-- The header files R_ext/BLAS.h, R_ext/Lapack.h and R_ext/Linpack.h contains declarations of the BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK linear algebra functions included in R. -->
