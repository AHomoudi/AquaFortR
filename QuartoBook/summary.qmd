# Conclusions and Optimization Insights {#chap-summary}

- positive features of R 
- positive features of Fortran 
  <!-- - https://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~kley/lehre/ftn77/tutorial/arrays2.html -->
- Why .Fortran() should not be used. dotCall64 is recommended for scripts. 
- Mention the memory allocation issues related to .Fortran
- OpenMp implementation in Fortran, [Romp](https://github.com/wrathematics/Romp) 
- Explain how beneficial R, Fortran with OpenMP is. For examples calculating cape for each vertical profile 
in a high resolution (1-4km) climate simulation (years) output (nlat, lon, nlevels, ntime) can be accelerated 
by passing the whole input arrays from R to Fortran, then loop over (nlat, lon, ntime) with OpenMP. 

- The cross-correlation can be speed up by using FFT. Also, in Fortran, the FFTW C library can be used. 
- Possibility of calling BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK linear algebra functions 
- Fortran using C (R_ext/BLAS.h, R_ext/Lapack.h and R_ext/Linpack.h)

- Final words why packaging is better.
