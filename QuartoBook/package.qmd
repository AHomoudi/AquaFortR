# Accelerate R Packages with Fortran

This chapter will focus on wrapping the developed routines from the previous chapter in an R package.

## Brief Introduction to R Packages

### devtools package
<!-- https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/ -->
## Developing AquaFortR Package 

### Fortran subroutine 

iso_c_binidng
<!-- -  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Intrinsic-Types.html -->

### R function 

### C funtions
 - C to Fortran 
 - R to C  

###  Package's files  


<!-- .Fortran is primarily intended for Fortran 77 code, and long precedes any support for ‘modern’ Fortran. Nowadays implementations of Fortran support the Fortran 2003 module iso_c_binding, a better way to interface modern Fortran code to R is to use .C and write a C interface using use iso_c_binding.  -->
<!-- F77_NAME(name) to declare a Fortran routine in C before use  -->
<!-- F77_CALL(name) to call a Fortran routine from C  -->


<!-- void R_orderVector (int* indx, int n, SEXP arglist, Rboolean nalast, Rboolean decreasing) -->

<!-- Cross Platform Development -->
