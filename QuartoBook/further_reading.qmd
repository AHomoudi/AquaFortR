<!-- Fortran is primarily intended for Fortran 77 code, and long precedes any support for Fortran 9x. Now current implementations of Fortran 9x support the Fortran 2003 module iso_c_binding, a better way to interface modern Fortran code to R is to use .C and write a C interface using use iso_c_binding.  -->

<!-- The header files R_ext/BLAS.h, R_ext/Lapack.h and R_ext/Linpack.h contains declarations of the BLAS, LAPACK and LINPACK linear algebra functions included in R. -->
